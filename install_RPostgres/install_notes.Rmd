Modern Postgres Driver
======================

```{r}
# Evidently RPostgreSQL has gone fallow and doesn't give us what we'd like in the way of bind parameters.
# Hadley Wickam and co are on the case with RPostgres, but it's a bit bleeding edge.

# Installing devtools was a bit of a circus:
# devtools requires rversions requires xml2 requires Rcpp >= 0.11.4.6
# fortunately, Rcpp in CRAN is at 0.12.2
devtools::install_github("RcppCore/Rcpp")
devtools::install_github("rstats-db/DBI")

# copy from Makevars in this directory to ~/.R/Makevars
# to help the configure script use pkg-config to find stuff.
devtools::install_github("rstats-db/RPostgres")
```
